# DataReplicationProject

In data grids, it is often a challenging requirement to minimize the access times in a wide distributed system for high availability of data. To achieve this, a technique called data replication, where data is replicated to local sites on the need and access history basis is used.  There are various dynamic replication strategies proposed in the past like DRCP, where a single file is replicated in one cycle.  In this paper, we propose a new dynamic replication algorithm for data grids called Second-File Pre-fetch (SFPF). In SFPF, we use the concept of pre-fetching a second popular file for replication along with the first popular file in the same time interval. The basic idea is that the file with more popularity has the high probability of access requests in the future. SFPF uses the same algorithm as DRCP to select popular files and the best site for replica. Experimental results show that by replicating two files SFPF performs better in all scenarios compared to DRCP. OptorSim is used to evaluate the performance of these dynamic replication schemes. SFPF shows an average improvement of 27% in job execution time compared to DRCP.
